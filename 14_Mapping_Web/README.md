# Earthquake Visualization Data with Leaflet

JSON data was pulled from United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short for 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days' and Leaflet was used to create the interactive map below that plots all of the earthquakes in the data set.

An additional tectonic plates layer was added to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
